# Color Notepad

Color Notepad is a simple application that allows users to create and store notes, functioning similar to a digital notepad. Users have the ability to choose the color of each note, and the notes are stored in the browser's local storage.

## Features

- **Note Creation:** Create and store notes with customizable colors.
- **Local Storage:** All notes are saved in the local storage of the browser.

## Usage

1. Open the deployed version [link](https://color-notepad.netlify.app).
2. Create notes by selecting a color and typing your content.
3. Notes will be saved automatically in the browser's local storage.

## Run
`npm run dev`
Initiates the application in development mode. Visit http://localhost:5173 in your browser to view the real-time application. The page will automatically refresh upon changes in the source code. Any style errors will also be displayed in the console.

`npm run build`
Builds the application for production in the build folder. This action optimizes the build for better performance by minimizing files. Once completed, your application will be ready for deployment in production.

`npm run lint`
Runs ESLint to search and display style errors in your JavaScript and JSX files. This command uses the configuration defined in your project and provides an error report without allowing warnings in your code (--max-warnings 0).

`npm run preview`
Initiates a preview of the application using Vite. This functionality enables you to visualize your application in a development environment and conduct testing.
